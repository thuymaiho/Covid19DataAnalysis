# Covid19DataAnalysis
I conducted with the Covid19 dataset including data on the cumulative number of confirmed cases per day in each country. Also, I used another dataset of different living factors evaluated by people living in different countries worldwide.

I preprocessed and merged datasets to evaluate necessary measures and prepare for the analysis. I merged the two datasets to see if there is a correlation between the wide spread of the Virus Covid19 in a country and the level of happiness people are having, living in that nation.

Specific skills Iâ€™ve worked with Python Programming, Pandas, Seaborn, and Statistics.
